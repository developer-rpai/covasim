'''
Check that v4 gives the same results as v3, on average

Each test runs several seeds of a v4 sim, and compares the mean of each result
with the mean from v3.1.8 (stored in the v3_*.json files). Results can't be compared
seed-by-seed, since v3 and v4 use different random number streams. A result
fails if it differs by more than z_threshold standard errors.

To regenerate the v3 results, see the README.
