"""
Contact networks for Covasim, using Starsim's networks.

The "random" population type has a single random network, ``a``; the "hybrid" population type uses
``ss.HybridNet``, which becomes four networks when added to the sim: households (``h``), schools
(``s``), workplaces (``w``), and community (``c``). As in v3, the networks are static, and the number
of contacts (or the household size) is Poisson distributed. Per-layer transmissibility (v3's
``beta_layer``) is applied by the disease (``cv.COVID.pars.beta_layer``), so the edge betas are 1.
